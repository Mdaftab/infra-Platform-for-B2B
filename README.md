## Getting Started

Follow these steps to deploy the platform:

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Platform account with organization-level access
- `gcloud` CLI installed and configured
- `kubectl` CLI installed
- `terraform` CLI installed
- `helm` CLI installed
- GitHub account for CI/CD pipelines

### Step 1: Set Up Infrastructure Project

1. Create your infrastructure project in Google Cloud:

```bash
# Create Infrastructure Project
gcloud projects create your-infra-project-id --name="Infrastructure"
```

2. Run the setup script to initialize the infrastructure:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The script will prompt you for your project ID and set up all necessary resources.

### Step 2: Update Configuration Values

Edit the following files with your specific project information:

1. **Terraform Variables** (`infra/environments/dev/terraform.tfvars`):
   - Replace the project ID with your infrastructure project ID
   - Update any other configuration values specific to your environment

2. **Terraform Backend** (`infra/environments/dev/backend.tf`):
   - Replace `your-terraform-state-bucket` with your GCS bucket name

3. **Crossplane Claims**:
   - Update project IDs in:
     - `crossplane/xresources/dev-gke-cluster-claim.yaml`
     - `crossplane/xresources/staging-gke-cluster-claim.yaml`
     - `crossplane/xresources/prod-gke-cluster-claim.yaml`

4. **Application Values** (`workloads/hello-world/values.yaml`):
   - Replace `gcr.io/your-gcp-project-id/hello-world` with your container registry path

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Your infrastructure project ID
- `GCP_SA_KEY`: Base64-encoded service account key (output from setup script)
- `GCP_TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET`: GCS bucket name for Terraform state

### Step 4: Deploy Infrastructure

1. Run the GitHub Action workflow to deploy the infrastructure:
   - Go to the Actions tab in your repository
   - Select the "Deploy Infrastructure" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"

2. After infrastructure deployment completes, run the "Bootstrap Crossplane" workflow

3. Once Crossplane is ready, run the "Provision Dev Cluster" workflow

4. Finally, run the "Deploy Application" workflow to deploy the sample application

## Architecture Details

### 1. Infracluster (GKE in Host Project)

- **Purpose**: Centralized management cluster
- **Configuration**:
  - Regional cluster with 1-3 nodes
  - Machine type: e2-standard-2
  - Runs Crossplane for application cluster management
  - Located in the infrastructure subnet

### 2. Application Clusters (Service Projects)

Each environment has its own dedicated GKE cluster:

| Environment | Type | Machine Type | Node Count | Purpose |
|-------------|------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Development | Zonal | e2-standard-2 | 1-3 | Feature development and testing |
| Staging | Regional | e2-standard-2 | 2-5 | Pre-production validation |
| Production | Regional | e2-standard-4 | 3-7 | Production workloads |

### 3. Networking

The infrastructure cluster VPC has the following configuration, and each client gets a similar dedicated network:

```
Infrastructure VPC Network (10.0.0.0/8)
│
├── 10.0.0.0/20    - Infra Subnet      - For Infracluster
│   ├── 10.16.0.0/16  - Pod CIDR         - For Infracluster Pods
│   └── 10.17.0.0/20  - Service CIDR     - For Infracluster Services
│
├── 10.20.0.0/20   - Dev Subnet        - For Dev Cluster
│   ├── 10.32.0.0/16  - Pod CIDR         - For Dev Pods
│   └── 10.33.0.0/20  - Service CIDR     - For Dev Services  
│
├── 10.40.0.0/20   - Staging Subnet    - For Staging Cluster
│   ├── 10.48.0.0/16  - Pod CIDR         - For Staging Pods
│   └── 10.49.0.0/20  - Service CIDR     - For Staging Services
│
├── 10.60.0.0/20   - Prod Subnet       - For Prod Cluster
│   ├── 10.64.0.0/16  - Pod CIDR         - For Prod Pods
│   └── 10.65.0.0/20  - Service CIDR     - For Prod Services
│
├── 10.80.0.0/20   - DB Subnet         - For Future Databases
│
└── 10.0.16.0/22   - Proxy Subnet      - For External Services
```

This carefully planned IP address allocation ensures no conflicts between environments.

   - Update the cluster name and other parameters as needed
   - Apply the claim using kubectl or the CI/CD pipeline

2. **For client-specific environments**:
   - Use the provided scripts for easy client onboarding:
     ```bash
     # For complete automated client onboarding
     ./scripts/onboard-client.sh
     
     # Or use the dedicated VPC cluster creation script directly
     ./scripts/create-client-cluster-dedicated.sh
     ```

The architecture supports unlimited clusters without any networking constraints.

## B2B Client Onboarding

The platform uses dedicated projects with isolated VPCs for complete tenant separation, providing maximum security and isolation for each client.

### One-Command Client Onboarding

For the fastest onboarding experience, use the comprehensive onboarding script:

```bash
./scripts/onboard-client.sh
```

This script automates the entire process, including:
- GCP project creation
- API enablement
- Service account setup
- GKE cluster provisioning with dedicated VPC
- Cloud SQL database provisioning (optional)
- GitHub repository and project creation
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Kubernetes add-on installation

The script will prompt you for all necessary information and execute each step in sequence.

### Step-by-Step Client Onboarding

If you prefer to understand each step of the process, you can follow this step-by-step guide:

#### 1. Set Up Client GCP Project

First, create a dedicated GCP project for the client:

```bash
# Create new client project
gcloud projects create CLIENT_PROJECT_ID --name="Client Name"

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com \
  cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com iam.googleapis.com \
  --project=CLIENT_PROJECT_ID

# Create service account for GKE nodes
gcloud iam service-accounts create gke-node-sa \
  --project=CLIENT_PROJECT_ID \
  --display-name="GKE Node Service Account"

# Grant required permissions
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding CLIENT_PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:gke-node-sa@CLIENT_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/container.nodeServiceAccount"
```

#### 2. Provision Client-Specific GKE Cluster with Dedicated VPC

Use the dedicated client provisioning script:

```bash
./scripts/create-client-cluster-dedicated.sh
```

This script will:
- Create a dedicated VPC in the client's project
- Provision a subnet with necessary secondary IP ranges
- Create a Cloud NAT gateway for external connectivity
- Configure firewall rules for the client's network
- Generate a Crossplane claim for the GKE cluster
- Optionally set up a dedicated Cloud SQL database
- Apply the claim to Crossplane for provisioning

#### 3. Set Up GitHub Project and Repository for Client

Create a GitHub project and repository for the client's InfraSearch deployment:

```bash
# Create GitHub project, repository, and CI/CD pipeline
./scripts/setup-github-client.sh "infrasearch" "CLIENT_NAME" "CLIENT_DESCRIPTION" "infrasearch/client-template"
```

This script will:
- Create a GitHub project in your organization for tracking client work
- Create a repository from a template with application code
- Set up GitHub Actions secrets for cluster access
- Configure CI/CD pipelines for automatic deployment
- Provide documentation for client application management

#### 4. Configure Client Cluster

After the cluster is provisioned, install the necessary add-ons:

```bash
# Connect to the client cluster
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLIENT_NAME-gke-cluster \
  --project=CLIENT_PROJECT_ID --region=us-central1

# Install cluster add-ons
./kubernetes-addons/install.sh
```

For production environments, use GitOps-based installation:

```bash
./scripts/install-addons-gitops.sh
```

#### 5. Deploy Client Applications via GitHub

The client's applications will be automatically deployed from GitHub to their dedicated cluster:

1. Clone the client repository:
   ```bash
   gh repo clone infrasearch/CLIENT_NAME
   ```

2. Make changes to the application code

3. Push to the main branch to trigger deployment:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update application configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
   - Build a Docker image for the application
   - Push it to Google Container Registry
   - Deploy it to the client's GKE cluster
   - Verify the deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Infrastructure Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Terraform errors** | Check that your GCP service account has the required permissions and that all placeholders in terraform.tfvars are replaced |
| **VPC creation fails** | Verify APIs are enabled with `gcloud services list --project=CLIENT_PROJECT_ID` |
| **Cluster creation fails** | Check Crossplane logs with `kubectl logs -l app=crossplane -n crossplane-system` |
| **Network connectivity** | Check VPC configuration: `gcloud compute networks describe CLIENT_NAME-network --project=CLIENT_PROJECT_ID` |
| **Client IAM issues** | Ensure node service account has proper permissions with `gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy gke-node-sa@CLIENT_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com` |
| **Database connectivity** | Check VPC peering between GKE and Cloud SQL with `gcloud compute networks peerings list --network=CLIENT_NAME-network --project=CLIENT_PROJECT_ID` |

### Troubleshooting Client-Specific Issues

| Component | Potential Issues | Solution |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| GCP Project | Quota limits | Request quota increases in Google Cloud Console |
| IAM | Missing permissions | Verify service account roles with `gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy` |
| Networking | Cloud NAT issues | Check NAT configuration with `gcloud compute routers nats describe` |
| GKE | Cluster creation failures | Verify API enablement and check Crossplane logs |
| Database | Connectivity problems | Check private service access in the client's VPC |

### Validating Your Deployment

After completing all the steps, validate that everything is working:

```bash
# Check infracluster is running
gcloud container clusters list --project=your-infra-project-id

# Verify Crossplane installation
kubectl --context=infracluster get providers

# List all clusters created by Crossplane (including client clusters)
kubectl --context=infracluster get gkecluster.platform.commercelab.io

# Connect to a client cluster
gcloud container clusters get-credentials client-name-gke-cluster \
  --project=client-project-id --region=us-central1

# Check deployed applications
kubectl get pods -n default
```

## Cleanup

To remove all resources when you're done:

```bash
./scripts/cleanup.sh
```

The script will prompt you for your project ID and handle the cleanup process.
